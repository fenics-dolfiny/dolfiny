## 🎓 Student & Internship Projects

As part of the study programs at the University of Luxembourg, internships or other arrangements, we offer the possibility to get involved with open source software development of modern finite element solutions.

Projects may address problems ranging across
- modern IT infrastructure (containerized applications, CI/CD pipelines, dependency management),
- software development (efficient implementations, automated testing, adaptation of modern code practices and tooling),
- numerics (non-linear solvers, optimisation algorithms, parallel data structures), and
- civil engineering (models and design of: beam-, truss- or continua).
